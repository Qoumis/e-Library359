# e-Library359

## Description

The purpose of this web-based system is to allow students studying in Crete to borrow books from libraries throughout Crete. It supports three types of users:

1.Students who can borrow and write reviews for books they have borrowed in the past.
2.Library administrators who manage a library (adding new books, etc.).
3.Simple visitors who can search for books and view information about them but cannot borrow them."


## How to run

To run the system, you need an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) in which you simply load the project as it is. Then, you need to add the libraries that are inside the software folder (gson and mysql-connector) to the project structure and reload the pom.xml file.
You also need a local server (like Tomcat or glassfish).
